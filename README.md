### Purpose
[LSMR](http://www.stanford.edu/group/SOL/software/lsmr.html) is a least-squares solver that ensures monotonic decrease in the norm of the gradient of each iteration.

The main purpose of the SLIM fork of LSMR is to ensure compatibility with [SPOT](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/scl/spot/) and [pSPOT](https://github.com/slimgroup/pSPOT).
